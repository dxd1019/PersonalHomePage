# Zeros-Inspired Website Project

## Overview

This project is a homework assignment to create a website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The design and theme of the website are inspired by the album [*Zeros*](https://declanmckenna.lnk.to/ZerosAW!musicpage) by [**Declan McKenna**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_McKenna). The project showcases different web development techniques and styling based on the themes and aesthetics of the album.

## Project Structure

The website follows a simple and organized structure:

```
.
├── assets/ # Contains all the images, fonts, and other media files, with the CSS and the script folder as well
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css # The main CSS file for styling the website
│   ├── fonts
│   ├── images
│   └── js/
│       └── script.js # The JavaScript file for interactions
└── pages/ # Contains the HTML files for different pages of the website
    └── index.html # The main landing page of the website
```
